# Contact Form

> > Project URL: https://roadmap.sh/projects/contact-form

> The goal of this project is to teach you how to build a real, accessible HTML form. You will set up form controls, labels, validation attributes, and proper grouping — without any JavaScript. Do not style the page; styling will be addressed in a later project. Focus here on the form structure that the browser and the server actually rely on.

In this project, you are required to build a single HTML page containing a contact form. The page should follow this structure:

You do not need a real backend. The form should be wired up as if you did, so a server inspecting the submission would receive exactly the name and value pairs you expect.

## Key requirements:

- A `<form>` element with action set to a placeholder URL and `method="post"`.
- Real labels for every input, paired by for and id. A placeholder is not a label.
- The following fields:
  - Full name (`type="text"`, `required`).
  - Email (`type="email"`, `required`).
  - Subject (`<select>` with at least three `<option>`s).
  - Message (`<textarea>`, `required`, with a `minlength`).
  - A "How did you hear about us?" group using `<input type="radio">` inputs grouped inside a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>`.
  - An optional newsletter `<input type="checkbox">`.
- A submit button with type="submit" and clear text — no "click here".
- Browser validation attributes where appropriate (`required`, `minlength`, `type="email"`). Remember these are a UX layer, not a security boundary; the server would still have to validate - the data on its own.
- Head metadata: Set `<title>`, `<meta charset>`, and `<meta viewport>`.

## Submission Checklist:

- A `<form>` with action and `method="post"`.
- Every form control paired with a `<label>` (either for/id or wrapped).
- Required fields marked with required.
- Radio buttons grouped in a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>`.
- A `<select>` with at least three `<option>`s and a `<textarea>` with a `minlength`.
- A `<button type="submit">` to send the form.
- Head metadata set correctly.

After completing the page, open DevTools, switch to the Network tab, tick "Preserve log", and submit the form. You will see the name and value pairs you defined turning into a real HTTP request — exactly the data a backend would receive. That habit of seeing "the form becomes a request" is one of the most useful instincts a backend or fullstack developer can pick up early.
