# Photo Showcase

> Project URL: https://roadmap.sh/projects/photo-showcase

The goal of this project is to teach you how to handle images, captions, and embedded media in HTML. You will build a page that displays a small collection of images with proper alt text, captions, and one embedded video. Do not style the page; styling will be addressed in a later project. Focus here on the markup that decides how the media is loaded, described, and announced.

In this project, you are required to build a single HTML page that showcases a small collection of photos or images.

You can use your own images, public images, or placeholder URLs - the focus is on the markup, not the photos.

## Key requirements:

- A semantic page: Use `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` to structure the page itself.
- At least six images inside the main content. Each `<img>` must include:
  - A `src` that points to a real image (a local file or a public URL).
  - A useful `alt` attribute that describes the image, not the filename.
  - `width` and `height` attributes to reserve layout space and prevent the page from jumping as images load.
- Captions on at least three images using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`. Remember: the `alt` text stands in for the image when it cannot be seen; the caption gives extra context to everyone.
- One decorative image (put any image) with `alt=""` so screen readers skip it. Leaving the attribute off entirely is different - always include it.
- One embedded `<video>` with controls, a poster image, and fallback text between the opening and closing tags. If you do not have a video file, use any small `.mp4` you have on your computer; the player UI will still appear from the markup alone.
- Head metadata: Set `<title>`, `<meta charset>`, and `<meta viewport>`.

# Submission Checklist:

- A single HTML page with header, main, and footer regions.
- At least six `<img>` elements, each with `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height`.
- Three or more images wrapped in `<figure>` with `<figcaption>`.
- One decorative image with `alt=""`.
- One `<video>` with controls, poster, and fallback content.
- Head metadata set correctly.

By completing this project, you will leave with a clear sense of how `alt` text is different from a caption, why dimensions on `<img>` matter for layout, and how `<video>` builds its player from the attributes you write. These habits pay off everywhere images and media appear later.
