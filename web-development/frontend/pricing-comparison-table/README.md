# Pricing Comparison Table

> Project URL: https://roadmap.sh/projects/pricing-comparison-table

The goal of this project is to teach you how to display structured data in HTML using a real, accessible table. You will build a small pricing comparison page with proper headers, a caption, and row scopes. Do not style the page; styling will be addressed in a later project. Focus here on the table structure and the surrounding semantic markup.

In this project, you are required to build a single HTML page that compares three subscription plans side by side using an HTML table.

## Key requirements:

- A semantic page: Use `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` to structure the page itself.
- A real `<table>` with `<thead>` and `<tbody>` separating header rows from data rows.
- A `<caption>` as the first child of the table that names what is being compared.
- Header scopes: Use `scope="col"` on column headers, and `scope="row"` on the plan-name cells so screen readers can announce data in context.
- At least one merged cell: Add colspan or rowspan somewhere meaningful — a section heading above several columns, or a highlight row that spans the table.
- Head metadata: Set `<title>`, `<meta charset>`, and `<meta viewport>`.

## Submission Checklist:

- A single HTML file with a semantic page structure (header, main, footer).
- A `<table>` with a `<caption>`, `<thead>`, and `<tbody>`.
- `scope="col"` on column headers and `scope="row"` on row headers.
- At least one cell using colspan or rowspan for a real reason.
- Page metadata set correctly in the head.

By completing this project, you will have a working mental model of when to reach for a table and when not to, and how to mark up a table that is accessible from the moment it ships. You can return to it later to add styles or sticky headers with CSS without changing the structure.
