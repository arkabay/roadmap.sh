# Theme Switcher with CSS Variables

> Project URL: https://roadmap.sh/projects/theme-switcher

The goal of this project is to teach you how to organize a stylesheet around design tokens and use CSS state to swap those tokens.

In this project, you are required to build a tiny UI that can switch between multiple themes using only HTML and CSS. Keep the interface basic: a row of three theme options and one preview card with a heading, short paragraph, and button.

The theme switch should work without JavaScript by using radio inputs with labels and either `:has` or sibling selectors. Below is a rough mockup showing the same card in three theme states.

## Things to keep in mind

- Tokens at `:root:` Define a small token layer (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text`, `--color-accent`, `--radius-md`, etc.) at `:root`.
- Theme variants: Override the same token names for light, dark, and one custom theme. The card should reference tokens, not hardcoded colors.
- Switch without JavaScript: Use three radio inputs and labels for the theme options. Target the checked state with `:has` or the general sibling combinator.
- Keep the markup the same: The themes should change the look of the same preview card. Do not duplicate the card for each theme in your HTML.
- Avoid hardcoded colors anywhere outside the token layer.

## Requirements

- At least three themes must be defined.
- No JavaScript is allowed.
- The switcher controls must be visible and keyboard accessible.
- The same set of token names must be defined in every theme, so switching themes does not leave any token undefined.

After completing this project, you will understand how a small set of CSS variables can power several visual themes, and how CSS selectors can handle simple interface state without JavaScript.
